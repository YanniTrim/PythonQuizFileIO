This project was a class project meant to wok specifcially with FileIO
The main file allows the user to either check for quiz info, score a file, or exit the program.
When scoring a file, the program asks for a specfic file to score, it then checks if the file exists.
And if it does, it goes through the answers each student put parsing the answers and getting each students score
It then prints a report of the average score and creates a primitive bar graph of the score distribution and makes 
a new file with the quiz scores for each student.
